# React Lazy Progressive Image




### Why?

Because we would like to load a low resolution placeholder image initially and the load the high resolution image only when the image is in the viewport.

### How was this package made

A lot of code has been taken from <a href="https://github.com/FormidableLabs/react-progressive-image">react-progressive-image</a>, the only addition being the usage of <a href="https://github.com/joshwnj/react-visibility-sensor">react-visibility-sensor</a> to check if there is a need to load the image.
